Youâ€™ll always be responsible for:

* Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
* The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

* The physical datacenter
* The physical network
* The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

* Operating systems
* Network controls
* Applications
* Identity and infrastructure
